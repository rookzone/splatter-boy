# Splatter Boy
A fun little project where I mess around with C and GBDK. Attempt at a pinball game with pre-calculated physics.

06/11/25 - I am officially beginning this project. The first goal is to create a ball with gravity that can hit a wall and bounce until it's energy has depleted.

## Styles

C styles:

## Compile instructions

1. Download GBDK and then copy `bin` into the root directory. LCC.exe is required.

### Make

Just use make. Check out
